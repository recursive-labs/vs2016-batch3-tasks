Part 1

b) Clone this to your local machine.

c)  Store all the three class notes you have written (three text files) 
    in the local repo, add, and commit.

d)  Push the local repo to github.com

Part 3
-------------

View (and try out on your machine - please note: just viewing videos is NOT enough 
... actively work  out everything on your system) the following 
videos (from the .iso image):

rl100/compilat

rl100/gdb 

(after you finish these videos, you should be capable of compiling,running and debugging 
simple  C programs on Linux. Even though we don't focus on C in this  course, 
it is good to have and understanding of stuff like this from a broader  perspective)

(note: if you haven't done any C programming, please check out some online resource and 
learn the very basics - just learn enough to let  you print messages on the screen 
using   "printf",read numbers using "scanf", do basic 
arithmetic/if statements/while/for loops. This should not take 
you more than 1 or 2  hours. Knowing  basic C is part of 
computer literacy - so please take it seriously).


Part 4
--------------

Download and untar:

http://pramode.net/downloads/bitops.tgz

You will get two  PDF's. Read the documents and make sure you understand 
everything PERFECTLY. Try out ALL the C programs - 
write extra C code of your own.

Bit manipulation and number representation is something which many students 
don't learn properly ... and it is VERY important in a lot 
of domains - not just low level embedded systems programming.

Please discuss on the list actively ... 


Time: 2 to 3  days.
