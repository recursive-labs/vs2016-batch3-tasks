a) Find out how for loops work in the   unix shell

b) Find out how "case statements" work in shell scripts

c) Find out how "command line arguments" can be accessed from a shell script

d) Write a script (call it "abc") which works like this:

./abc 2 20

this will print all numbers from 2  to 20.  The script should work with any two numbers, not just 2 and 20.

e) Write a shell script which will rename all the files in the current directory whose name contains upper-case characters into all lower case. For example, if the directory contains a file whose name is CoUnt.c, it should be renamed to count.c.
(hint: use a for  loop, use the "tr" command)

f) Write a shell script which will move all files in the current directory containing the word "linux" into a separate folder called "linux-files".

g)Write a shell script which will move all executable files in the current directory to a folder called "executables" (hint: read the man page of "test"; "test" can check many different attributes of a file)

h) Find out how these commands work: xargs, tee, find, sed, awk, cut, uniq, head, tail

i) Learn how to use "wget" to fetch data from URL's

------
Time: 1-2  days should be sufficient.

note: please put up all the shell scripts in a repo called "shell-scripts".
