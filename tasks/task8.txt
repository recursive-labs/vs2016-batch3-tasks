You can download the actual source code of the Python2 
programming language as a .tgz file (links given towards
the end of the page).

After downloading, do the following:

a) untar the archive and just go through the different
folders. Take a casual look at the C source files. For most
of you, this might be your first exposure to real world code.
Take some time to look at the way the C code is structured.

b) Can you identify the source file where the CPython virtual
machine decodes the byte-code instructions and calls specific
C functions to perform operations like "add two values", "compare
two values" etc?

c) Compile this source code to get a copy of the python programming
language executable. Try running this executable.

(This may take some effort if you are doing it for the first time.
You may have to install additional packages and do some exploration
on your own. Building software from source is a *very* important
activity).

The following might be of help:

d) Once you have access to the source code of a program, you can
modify it in any way you like. Can you make some silly, trivial
modification to the Python source code and build a new version of
Python which includes those modifications?
